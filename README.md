**Flyer Events Data Analysis**

**Overview**

This project processes a dataset of flyer events, calculates the following:
1. The number of unique users.
2. The average time spent by users on flyers.
3. The average time spent on a specific flyer (`flyer_id = 2020004`).

The calculations are performed using pandas and standard Python libraries.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- datetime (included in Python standard library)

**Script Explanation**

The script performs the following tasks:
1. **Loading Data**: Reads a CSV file containing flyer event data.
2. **Task 1**: Computes the number of unique users (`user_id`).
3. **Task 2**: Computes the average time spent on flyers by users.
4. **Task 3**: Computes the average time spent on `flyer_id = 2020004`.
5. **Function**: These tasks are wrapped in a function `flyer_data_tasks` for reusable analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('Task (Flyer events) dataset.csv')
data["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(data["timestamp"])

# **Task 1: Unique Users**
unique_users = data["user_id"].nunique()
print("Number of unique users:", unique_users)

# **Task 2: Average Time Spent on Flyers**
flyer_events = data[data["event"] == "flyer_open"].sort_values(["user_id", "timestamp"])
flyer_events["next_timestamp"] = flyer_events.groupby("user_id")["timestamp"].shift(-1)
flyer_events["time_spent"] = (flyer_events["next_timestamp"] - flyer_events["timestamp"]).dt.total_seconds()

flyer_events = flyer_events.dropna(subset=["time_spent"])  # Removing rows with no time spent
avg_time_per_user = flyer_events.groupby("user_id")["time_spent"].sum().mean()
print("Average time spent on flyers per user:", avg_time_per_user)

# **Task 3: Average Time Spent on Flyer ID 2020004**
flyer_events['flyer_id'] = flyer_events["flyer_id"].astype(int)  # Convert flyer_id to integer type
flyer_2020004 = flyer_events[flyer_events["flyer_id"] == 2020004]
avg_time_flyer_2020004 = flyer_2020004["time_spent"].mean()
print("Average time spent on flyer_id = 2020004:", avg_time_flyer_2020004)

# **Function to encapsulate all tasks**
def flyer_data_tasks(data):
    data["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(data["timestamp"])
    unique_users = data["user_id"].nunique()
    flyer_events = data[data["event"] == "flyer_open"].sort_values(["user_id", "timestamp"])
    flyer_events["next_timestamp"] = flyer_events.groupby("user_id")["timestamp"].shift(-1)
    flyer_events["time_spent"] = (flyer_events["next_timestamp"] - flyer_events["timestamp"]).dt.total_seconds()
    flyer_events = flyer_events.dropna(subset=["time_spent"])
    avg_time_per_user = flyer_events.groupby("user_id")["time_spent"].sum().mean()
    flyer_events['flyer_id'] = flyer_events["flyer_id"].astype(int)
    flyer_2020004 = flyer_events[flyer_events["flyer_id"] == 2020004]
    avg_time_flyer_2020004 = flyer_2020004["time_spent"].mean()
    return unique_users, avg_time_per_user, avg_time_flyer_2020004

# Running the function and displaying the results
unique_users, avg_time_per_user, avg_time_flyer_2020004 = flyer_data_tasks(data)
print("Unique users:", unique_users)
print("Average time spent on flyers per user:", avg_time_per_user)
print("Average time spent on flyer_id = 2020004:", avg_time_flyer_2020004)
``` 

**How to Run the Script**

1. **Download the dataset**: Ensure you have the CSV file (`Task (Flyer events) dataset.csv`) that contains the flyer event data.
   
2. **Install the required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas (if required)
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python flyer_events_analysis.py
   ```

4. The output will be printed to the console showing the following:
   - The number of unique users in the dataset.
   - The average time spent on flyers per user.
   - The average time spent on the flyer with `flyer_id = 2020004`.

**For Large Data Scales (1 Million Events and 1 Trillion Events)**

**For 1 Million Events (~10 MB of data)**

- **Memory Usage**: The script is optimized for datasets of this size. A machine with 8-16 GB RAM can easily process this data.
- **Performance**: The computation of the unique users and average times should take just a few seconds to a minute.
- **Environment**: A typical laptop or desktop will suffice for processing this data.

**For 1 Trillion Events (~1 TB of data)**

- **Memory Usage**: This data size exceeds the memory capacity of typical machines.
  - Distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark or Dask would be required.
  - Data needs to be partitioned across a distributed system (e.g., HDFS or AWS S3).
  
- **Processing Framework**: 
  - Spark provides parallel computation across clusters.
  - You would need to use partitioning strategies, for example, by `user_id` or `flyer_id`.
  
- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Use incremental computation, processing data in manageable chunks.
  - Use efficient storage formats like Parquet or ORC.
  - Data partitioning and caching would help with frequently accessed subsets.
  
- **Scalability**:
  - A cluster with sufficient computational nodes is necessary for scalability.
  - For better performance, consider using tools like Dask, which provide parallelism for pandas-like operations in a distributed environment.
